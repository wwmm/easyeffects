    <title>Multiband Gate</title>
    <p>Easy Effects uses the Multiband Gate Stereo developed by Calf Studio Gear. Please refer to the <link xref="gate" its:withinText="yes">Gate</link> documentation to comprehend the basic functionality of the gating process.</p>

                </title>
                <p>This Gate allows to split the input signal up to 8 bands. Each band is not attached to its strict frequency and can be controlled by completely different frequency range that can be obtained by applying Low-Cut and Hi-Cut filters to the Sidechain signal.</p>
                <p>The first band is always enabled while the others can be activated if needed. When only the first band is enabled, the functionality is similar to the Singleband Sidechain Gate. Otherwise the signal is split in more bands and each band is processed individually. After the gating stage, the bands are mixed together to form the output result.</p>

                            - The original signal is split using crossover filters. After the gating stage, all bands become phase-compensated using All-Pass filters.

                            - Each band is processed by a pair of dynamic shelving filters. This mode allows a better control over the gain of each band.

                </title>
                <p>If enabled, it introduces a special mode for assigning the same weight for higher frequencies opposite to lower frequencies.</p>
                <p>When disabled, the frequency band is processed 'as is', but the usual audio signal has 3 dB/octave falloff in the frequency domain and could be compared with the pink noise. So lower frequencies take more effect on the Gate rather than higher frequencies.</p>
                <p>On the other hand the Sidechain Boost mode allows to compensate the -3 dB/octave falloff of the signal spectrum and, even more, makes the signal spectrum growing +3 dB/octave in the almost fully audible frequency range.</p>
                <p>
                    <em style="strong">Pink</em> applies +3 dB/octave while
                    <em style="strong">Brown</em> applies +6 dB/octave Sidechain Boost.
                    Each of them can use bilinear-transformed (BT) or matched-transformed (MT) shelving filter.
