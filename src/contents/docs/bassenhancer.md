# Bass Enhancer

A Bass Enhancer is used to produce very low sound that is not present in the original signal. This is done by creating harmonic distortions of the signal which are restricted in range and added to the original signal. It raises the lower end of an audio signal without simply raising the lower frequencies like an [Equalizer](equalizer.md) would do to create a more "fat" or "boomy" sound.

**Amount**  
Amount of harmonics added to the original signal.

**Harmonics**  
Amount of newly created harmonics.

**Scope**  
The frequency above which harmonics are produced.

**Floor (button)**  
Constrain the enhancement on the lower end.

**Floor (value)**  
The frequency below which no harmonics are produced.

**Blend Harmonics**  
The "colour" (or octave) of the harmonics.

**Listen**  
Mute the original signal and listen to the harmonics exclusively.
