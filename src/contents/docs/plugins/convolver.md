# Convolver

The Convolver creates a simulation of an audio environment using a pre-recorded audio sample of the impulse response of the space being modeled. This feature is based on the "convolution": a process through which the sonic characteristics of one signal are used to alter the character of another.

Easy Effects Convolver offers the opportunity to apply multiple impulse responses by combining them in one file.

**Impulses**  
Manage impulse response files. This menu allows to load a specific impulse or add/remove files from the Easy Effects configuration directory.

**Combine**  
Select two impulse responses to combine into a single file to be saved under the Easy Effects configuration directory.

**Stereo Width**  
Modify the impulse response stereo image width.

**Spectrum**  
Visualize the frequency spectrum of the selected channel.
