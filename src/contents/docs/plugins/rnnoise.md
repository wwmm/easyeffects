# Noise Reduction

The Noise Reduction is a process aimed to attenuate the disturbing noise from a signal.

Easy Effects Noise Reduction is made on the RNNoise library which is based based on recurrent neural network, a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

Standard RNNoise Model is used and custom models can be imported to perform different types of noise reduction.
