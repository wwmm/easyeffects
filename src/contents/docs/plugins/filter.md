# Filter

A Filter is used to amplify (boost), pass or attenuate (cut) defined parts of a frequency spectrum. Easy Effects uses the Filter from Calf Studio Gear.

**Mode**  
The type of the filter.

**Frequency**  
The center or cut-off frequency of the filter.

**Resonance**  
Add an accentuation to the center frequency. When used on a bandpass the surrounding frequencies are decreased in level and the band gets more narrow. A bandreject is narrowed down to a thin needle.

**Inertia**  
Smooths the jumps between frequencies.
