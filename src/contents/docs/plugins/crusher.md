# Crusher

A bitcrusher reduces the resolution or bandwidth of digital audio data. Audio reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital". 
In the bitcrusher from Calf Studio Gear used in EasyEffects reduction can be done in a linear or logarithmic way.
According to the plugin authors the logarithmic way results in a much smoother sound in low volume signals. 

**Mode**  
- **Linear** - Linear distance between bits.
- **Logarithmic** - Logarithmic distances between bits. The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn't gate low signals. 

**Bit reduction**  
To do. 

**DC offset**  
This offset causes different crushing of the lower and the upper half of the signal. 

**Anti-aliasing**  
Controls the softness of the crushing sounds. 

**Mix**  
To do. 

**Reduction**  
To do. 

**Low frequency oscillator active**  
Enable the low frequency oscillator. 

**Low frequency oscillator range**  
To do. 

**Low frequency oscillator rate**  
To do.
