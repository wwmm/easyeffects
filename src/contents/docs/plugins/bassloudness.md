# Bass Loudness

The ear is less sensitive to low frequencies when listening at low volume. This plugin developed by MDA allows the bass level to be adjusted measuring the "equal-loudness contour".

**Loudness**  
Source level relative to listening level (based on a 100 dB SPL maximum level).

**Output**  
Change output level.

**Link**  
Automatically adjusts Output to maintain a consistent tonal balance at all levels.
