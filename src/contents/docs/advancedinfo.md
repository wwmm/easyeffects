# Advanced Information

Easy Effects audio processing is composed by three main stages. Each of them needs a specific audio format and sampling rate.

In the bottom bar is reported the pipeline output sampling rate (in kHz) and the latency (in ms) introduced by the audio processing stage.

Every stream in applications list also reports its own latency and sampling rate, along with status and format.
