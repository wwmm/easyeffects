# Applications Excluded

There are cases in which the user wants a specific application to be excluded from the "Process All Input/Output" functionality. This can be done by using the list of Excluded Applications.

Just click the "Excluded Apps" button in the bottom bar and add the application name exactly as it is shown in the Players/Recorders tab list.

A specific application in the Players/Recorders list can be quickly added to the Excluded Apps just clicking the "Exclude" checkbutton.
