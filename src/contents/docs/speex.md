# Speech Processor

This plugin allows EasyEffects to use the Speex preprocessor to attenuate disturbing background noises from a signal.

Compared to Noise Reduction which uses RNNoise to suppress noises, Speech Processor has the benefit of using less computational resources, at the cost of sacrificing noise suppression quality.

For more information on noise suppression in general, refer to the manual page on Noise Reduction.
