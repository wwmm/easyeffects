# Crossfeed

Easy Effects uses the Crossfeed by bs2b. This plugin is used to improve headphone listening of stereo audio records. It does so by mixing the left and right channel in a way that simulates a stereo speaker setup while using headphones.

**Cutoff**  
Low-Pass filter cutoff frequency.

**Feed**  
Amount of signal from a channel that is sent to the other.

**Presets**  
- **Default** - Closest to virtual speaker placement (30°, 3 meters).
- **Cmoy** - Close to Chu Moy's Crossfeed (popular).
- **Jmeier** - Close to Jan Meier's CORDA amplifiers (little change).
