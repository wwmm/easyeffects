# Saturation Warning

If the audio signal coming out from the pipeline is too high, very unpleasant noises can be produced. In case this happens a warning icon is shown near the output level meter in the bottom bar so that the user can reduce the audio level using the [Limiter](limiter.md) or the [Maximizer](maximizer.md) plugin.
