# Reverberation

Reverberation is the phenomenon of persistence of sound after the source has been stopped as a result of multiple reflections of the waves over objects within a closed surface. These reflections build up with each other and decay gradually as they are absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space enclosed.

The Reverberation is different than Echo because the Echo is a reflected sound wave with sufficient magnitude and delay to be detectable as a signal distinct from the source one. To simulate the Reverberation effect, Easy Effects uses the Reverb plugin developed by Calf Studio Gear.

**High Frequency Damping**  
Cutoff frequency of the reflections. It causes higher frequencies to decay faster.

**Room Size**  
Size of the space where simulated Reverberation occurs inside. It determines the time between reflections.

**Diffusion**  
Degree of uniformity. Higher values lead to less uniform Reverberation.

**Pre Delay**  
Additional delay. It corresponds to a distance between sound source and the nearest wall.

**Decay Time**  
The time it takes for Reverberation to fade out.

**Dry Level**  
Amount of unprocessed signal mixed in the output.

**Wet Level**  
Amount of processed signal (Reverberation) mixed in the output.

**Bass Cut**  
Removes low frequencies from the Reverberation.

**Treble Cut**  
Removes high frequencies from the Reverberation.
