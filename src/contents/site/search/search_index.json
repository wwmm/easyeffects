Introduction If you're a notebook user relying on your internal speakers and you - like me - own a model suffering from a tinny, clanging sound, Easy Effects is your salvation! Commercial operating systems on laptops these days often come with software like Dolby Theatre and the like to enhance the sound of lousy notebook speakers to something more substantial and acoustically rich. Under Linux, Easy Effects will do the job for you, although, compared to the commercial pendants, there's some manual tweaking required until the community sets up a database with presets for common machines. This DSP software comes with everything needed to fatten the sound of your laptop speakers with a flexibility never found in other operating systems. Unfortunately the drawback of this flexibility is that average users will get lost in the sheer amount of possibilities. That's why this tutorial was created. Why no Equalizer? We will attack the problems one by one utilizing specific signal processors, deliberately renouncing Equalizers. Equalizers are not of any help here but tend to make these kinds of problems even worse. This is because of the nature of this processor, but also because users tend to add to the signal (additive equalization) instead of trying to eliminate problems by removing from the signal (subtractive equalization) like it is usually done in the professional world. But even subtractive equalization wouldn't be of any help since the amplifiers and speakers in a notebook are not loud enough by default, so trying to eliminate problems this way leads to a quiet and still castrated sound. And raising the volume afterwards generally leads to distorted sounds and other problems because the system was at its limits beforehand and just fiddling with the frequency response doesn't help at all. Frequency Range We'll have to talk about the frequency range. For a better understanding and because of the way we will solve our problems I'll break it down to five ranges which are: Sub \u2013 More or less vibrations up to something an ear can barely hear. Everything from 10 Hz to ~40 Hz. Low or Bass \u2013 Where the whole fundament of a signal is located. Low end of bass drums, bass synthesizers and bass guitars are found here. Movies occupy this range with explosions, rumbling waters, thunder, heavy gun fire and the like. Absolutely missing on notebooks and tablets. Technically speaking it's ~60 Hz - ~200 Hz. Low-Mid \u2013 Hit a 0.5 m\u00b3 cardboard box and you know what low-mids are. The \"punch\" of a sound is often located here, also the juice of snare drums and electric guitars. In Movies, roaring engines and shotguns are found in this range. We're talking about ~250 Hz - ~750 Hz. High-Mid \u2013 This is the ears most important and sensitive range. The main information of any kind of signal is located here. Human voice, picking of guitars, attack of drums, the colour of a synthesizer - everything carrying the main information of sound. Something around ~1 kHz - ~4 kHz. Highs \u2013 The air, the breathe, the sizzling, the splashing - this is the range of brightness. Everything around and above ~5 kHz. Test Signal You definitely need a good signal for this job. I decided to use the song G\u20acLD by Seeed. It is quite snappy, has lots of well defined substance, clear and bright highs, present vocals, comes with a very balanced frequency response and is a great mix in combination with great mastering. Afterwards I tested against various movies and other stuff like talks, classical music and the like and was convinced of the result. Well produced, modern pop music (avoid the 80's and 90's stuff) is always a good test signal for this kind of job. Movies are way too dynamic, so is classical music, and they normally don't cover a steady, broad frequency range like this kind of signal. We will not be able to make the notebook bounce. What is the goal here is that everything contained in the mix gets audible in a well balanced manner and to gain a present, upfront, broad and hopefully rich sound. I assume you don't utilize a player or source which is able to produce levels above 0 dB. I also assume you don't use e.g. video players volume bar to lower the volume of your source. This approach works well for defined, mixed and mastered sound sources like music, movies, tv and the like, played back at 100% volume in the player. Set the desired volume directly on your hardware after the processing happened. Problems Let's investigate the biggest problems first: Bass The most obvious problem of notebook speakers is the tinny, pressure-free sound not reproducing any kind of low-end. This is because of the size of the membranes and the inadequate housing. Fortunately software can work around this issue at least a bit. Highs Often the highs are quite bitchy, not representing the \"air\" but torturing the listener with searing sibilants. In order to fix that we need to equal this frequency range out. Overall Frequency Response Normally the relation between the different frequency ranges low, low-mid, high-mid and height is quite out-of-bounds. This needs correction, although I promised a tutorial without EQ. Distortion Because of the thin and neutered sound users tend to raise the volume or even add an Equalizer to raise missing frequency ranges. This normally leads to digital distortions because every signal above 0 dB at the sound card DAC will go from occasional crackling up to a totally distorted sound. Dynamic range With movies, but music as well, those tiny transducers tend to wiping away low-level sounds but going ballistic on loud and bassy sounds. For this reason it's recommended to reduce the overall dynamic range so you don't need to press your ear onto the palm rest when the lady in the movie starts whispering. Stereo Image The stereo base is quite narrow because of the positioning of the speakers inside the laptop which gives an impression of almost mono signals. Solutions Let's start fixing the sound. The result will not come even close to something more substantial but at least we'll be able to get the best out of the physical boundaries of these transducers. Every parameter we are gonna set absolutely depends on your situation and the hardware you've got. Every notebook has its own frequency response and dynamic range so there's no panacea. But the audio signal processors, their order and their missions are well defined and reproducible. Don't care about clipping in the plugins level meters. The signal will be processed as 32 bit numbers internally (check title bar) which gives a non-clipping overhead of hundreds of decibels. The only thing that shouldn't happen is that there's clipping when the signal hits the sound card DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter), which would result in digital distortion. Let's head over to the signal chain: Limiter We will start with the last signal processor being used. As I explained earlier, as soon as the signal hits the sound card DAC it has to be below 0 dB, otherwise it will result in a distorted, messy sound. Delete already present processors in the list, then add the Limiter. You will not hear any difference, which is what we expect. It will hit in as soon as we start messing up the signal with all the other processors. Set PreAmp to 0 dB, Lookahead to 4 ms, Attack to 2 ms and Release to 8 ms. A Limiter monitors the signal in (nearly) realtime and detects peaks over a certain Threshold, in our case 0 dB. Set also Stereo Link to 100%, Oversampling to Half x4, disable External Sidechain and Auto Leveling and leave remaining options to their defaults. As soon as a peak is detected, it starts lowering the volume constantly (within the Lookahead) until the peak will be below Threshold. Afterwards it raises the volume again (within release time frame) until it is back to normal. This way we avoid signals above Threshold hitting the DAC without being noticed too much. If one tries to overdo limiting, it will definitely result in distortion and other side effects, but in our case it's just a fire-and-forget troubleshooter so we can concentrate on the results without trying to mess with levelling over and over again. Don't overdo things! This might render your overall sound experience worse than before. Let's look at the real processing now. Filter First of all we should remove frequencies that cannot be heard because even if the speakers are unable to reproduce them a lot of energy will be wasted in the process. This will lead to problems like not being able to use the full dynamic range and the introduction of digital and physical distortions. Add the Filter to the list and place it on top, above the Limiter. Set the type to 36 dB High Pass (this will cut off everything below a frequency and will let everything above it pass) and the frequency to 50 Hz (which is definitely below your laptop's speakers abilities). Continuously raise the frequency by 10 Hz until you start hearing a change in the lower end of the audible signal, which should be around 130-160 Hz. Subtract 10% (or 15 Hz) and set it as the Filters frequency. On my machine it is 145 Hz, since the signal started being affected at 160 Hz. What happened is that we removed everything the speakers can't reproduce at all, leaving a little bit of signal just below this frequency, which is quite important for the next step. Bass Enhancer Let's grow some testicles to the signal. Add the Bass Enhancer and place it at the second position, between the Filter and the Limiter. Set the Floor to 10 Hz and forget about it (we already removed everything below the Filter plugin cutoff frequency). Raise Harmonics to 10 and start with a Scope of 200 Hz. Now start raising the Amount continuously until the bass takes over the whole energy, which is definitely too much. For me it works best at +24 dB. Which is huge but my ThinkPad P1 has the worst speakers I've ever heard in a 2.8k \u20ac notebook. What happens is that the Bass Enhancer adds frequencies to the signal which weren't there before. While an Equalizer only raises stuff which is already in the signal, a Bass Enhancer improves the lower end by adding distortion to a specific frequency range. This kind of distortion adds so called Harmonics to the signal which is a multiple of existing frequencies. On the Blend slider you can choose seamlessly between 2nd and 3rd Harmonics, which means that a frequency of 100 Hz produces a new signal of 200/300/400/600/800/900 Hz... at varying (due to the Harmonics setting) and constantly decreasing levels. This means we're effectively raising the lower range into something better reproducible. It doesn't add or raise the real fundament (so your trousers won't start to flutter), but makes more audible signals that have been swallowed by the hardware before. Later on, in order to refine the result, you should play with the Amount parameter to define the level of bass and maybe with the Scope to define the upper end of our additional Harmonics. Multiband Compressor This is the most demanding step in the chain. Even professionals have great respect for this signal processor since it's absolutely able to destroy your signals big time. But let's be honest, we're consumers and no one will hear the difference between 100 ms and 200 ms Attack time - even on notebook and tablet speakers. This means we can work with some reliable, well established defaults for the timing and frequency splits. The Multiband Compressor will solve several things for us. It will cut outstanding and annoying frequencies, lower the overall dynamic range and figure our overall frequency response. The latter is what most people try to achieve with an Equalizer. Thing is Equalizers aren't dynamic which will add to the problems instead of solving anything. Add the Multiband Compressor and place it at the third position, after the Bass Enhancer and before the Limiter. Since the Bass Enhancer really raised the energy and level of the signal, lower the Multiband Compressor input gain to -6 dB as a starting point. Enable bands 2, 3 and 4. Set Modern Operating Mode and disable the Sidechain Boost. Then let's set the split frequencies for the different bands: Band 2 Start: 250 Hz Band 3 Start: 1250 Hz Band 4 Start: 5000 Hz Afterwards let's set some defaults: Band 1 Attack Time: 150 ms Release Time: 300 ms Attack Threshold: -16 dB Ratio: 5 Knee: -12 dB Makeup: 4 dB Band 2 Attack Time: 150 ms Release Time: 200 ms Attack Threshold: -24 dB Ratio: 3 Knee: -9 dB Makeup: 4 dB Band 3 Attack Time: 100 ms Release Time: 150 ms Attack Threshold: -24 dB Ratio: 3 Knee: -9 dB Makeup: 4 dB Band 4 Attack Time: 80 ms Release Time: 120 ms Attack Threshold: -24 dB Ratio: 4 Knee: -9 dB Makeup: 4 dB Compression Mode for all enabled bands should be Downward. The remaining parameters can be left to their defaults. These values should be a good starting point. A Compressor lowers signal levels which appear above a certain Threshold. It adds a simple multiplication to the signal defined by the Ratio. If the Threshold is set to -24 dB and Ratio to 2, a signal of -12 dB would in fact become -18 dB. In this example one can then raise the Makeup parameter to 6 dB, since this is what went \"lost\". So first of all we're rendering loud signals quieter to then raise the overall volume, which leads to less dynamic range with quiet parts becoming more audible. The timing settings affect the \"speed\" of the compression. Attack means that a signal needs to go over Threshold for this amount of time until the Compressor reaches the full (negative) amplification. Release defines the amount of time the signal has to stay below Threshold until the amplification is back to 1 again. A Multiband Compressor splits the signal in various frequency ranges to work on them exclusively with dedicated compression stages. This means that a very loud bass drum would not affect a crash cymbal, since they are clearly located in different bands. Start playing around with these parameters: Makeup \u2013 This is probably most important setting in this concept. Makeup raises the signal after compression stage which means that it directly influences the perceived volume of every single band. Or in other words: this is your Equalizer :). Raise Makeup of single bands to make them louder or quieter. On my ThinkPad P1 I ended up with 4 dB, 3 dB, 6 dB and 6 dB respectively in band 1, 2, 3 and 4. Input Level \u2013 Set it to -6 dB by default, I ended up at -3 dB. What happens is that a higher input level pushes all bands of the Compressor equally, leading to a allegedly louder sound (well, the loudness was raised in fact) without tweaking every single band manually. This reduces the overall dynamic range, raising quiet parts and squeezing loud parts even more. Stereo Tools After figuring our overall sound let's look for some icing on the cake. Add the Stereo Tools and place it at the fourth position, after Multiband Compressor and before Limiter. This tool has a lot of functionality but we only need just a single parameter. Switch to the \"Output\" tab and set the parameter Stereo Base to 0.25. That's it. Stereo Base acts on the two channels. It adds inverted signals crossover-wise. This way one can bring a full stereo signal down to mono seamlessly (by going negative values, -1 is fully mono) but also raise the stereo base by choosing positive numbers. This setting has lots of side effects, so avoid overdoing it! One of the bigger problems is that it reduces the bass range due to different effects, which is something we definitely don't want here. Play with Stereo Base to spread the appearance of your sound to a nice, broad stage without losing the center (vocals, snare drums, conversations in movies) or substance in the lower end. Most likely values between 0 and 0.5 will give some good results. Aftermath Hopefully you ended up with a better sound than before. This signal processor chain is able to completely trash your sound if not done right but also can improve it to compete with some high class notebook speaker systems. All manufacturers put on the pants the same way and Dolby Theatre is no rocket science but just some presets on a presumably comparable set of signal processors set up in the presumably same way as this tutorial explained. When my notebook was new, I first ran the pre-installed Windows system in order to test if all hardware was working. Sound-wise I remembered the bad reputation of this machine in every test, so I tried some tunes on Youtube - and was quite convinced. After installing my Linux system the enthusiasm was totally gone - the sound turned into a squawking, pressure-less something. It became clear that all problems of the internal speakers where due to the missing sound chips DSP driver. But fortunately Wellington Wallace spent his spare-time casting the most important Calf and LSP plugins for this job into something usable on consumers systems. Thanks a bunch for that, mate! tl;dr Sorry dude, this isn't done by simply loading a preset, since the community is not Apple, Lenovo or Dell offering high quality Dolby Theatre drivers for your particular machine.","title":"Enhancing your internal notebook speakers without using an Equalizer"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#enhancing-your-internal-notebook-speakers-without-using-an-equalizer","text":"This tutorial was written for PulseEffects by Markus Schmidt (schmidt@boomshop.net) on November 2019 and updated two years later for the new Easy Effects on PipeWire.","title":"Enhancing your internal notebook speakers without using an Equalizer"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#introduction","text":"If you're a notebook user relying on your internal speakers and you - like me - own a model suffering from a tinny, clanging sound, Easy Effects is your salvation!

So first of all we're rendering loud signals quieter to then raise the overall volume, which leads to less dynamic range with quiet parts becoming more audible. The timing settings affect the \"speed\" of the compression. Attack means that a signal needs to go over Threshold for this amount of time until the Compressor reaches the full (negative) amplification. Release defines the amount of time the signal has to stay below Threshold until the amplification is back to 1 again. A Multiband Compressor splits the signal in various frequency ranges to work on them exclusively with dedicated compression stages. This means that a very loud bass drum would not affect a crash cymbal, since they are clearly located in different bands. Start playing around with these parameters: Makeup \u2013 This is probably most important setting in this concept. Makeup raises the signal after compression stage which means that it directly influences the perceived volume of every single band. Or in other words: this is your Equalizer :). Raise Makeup of single bands to make them louder or quieter. On my ThinkPad P1 I ended up with 4 dB, 3 dB, 6 dB and 6 dB respectively in band 1, 2, 3 and 4. Input Level \u2013 Set it to -6 dB by default, I ended up at -3 dB. What happens is that a higher input level pushes all bands of the Compressor equally, leading to a allegedly louder sound (well, the loudness was raised in fact) without tweaking every single band manually. This reduces the overall dynamic range, raising quiet parts and squeezing loud parts even more. Stereo Tools After figuring our overall sound let's look for some icing on the cake. Add the Stereo Tools and place it at the fourth position, after Multiband Compressor and before Limiter. This tool has a lot of functionality but we only need just a single parameter. Switch to the \"Output\" tab and set the parameter Stereo Base to 0.25. That's it. Stereo Base acts on the two channels. It adds inverted signals crossover-wise. This way one can bring a full stereo signal down to mono seamlessly (by going negative values, -1 is fully mono) but also raise the stereo base by choosing positive numbers. This setting has lots of side effects, so avoid overdoing it! One of the bigger problems is that it reduces the bass range due to different effects, which is something we definitely don't want here. Play with Stereo Base to spread the appearance of your sound to a nice, broad stage without losing the center (vocals, snare drums, conversations in movies) or substance in the lower end. Most likely values between 0 and 0.5 will give some good results.","title":"Solutions"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#aftermath","text":"Hopefully you ended up with a better sound than before. This signal processor chain is able to completely trash your sound if not done right but also can improve it to compete with some high class notebook speaker systems. All manufacturers put on the pants the same way and Dolby Theatre is no rocket science but just some presets on a presumably comparable set of signal processors set up in the presumably same way as this tutorial explained. When my notebook was new, I first ran the pre-installed Windows system in order to test if all hardware was working. Sound-wise I remembered the bad reputation of this machine in every test, so I tried some tunes on Youtube - and was quite convinced. After installing my Linux system the enthusiasm was totally gone - the sound turned into a squawking, pressure-less something.

This allows for natural suppression of background noise and unwanted whispers. For example, it is effective when air conditioning or other environmental sounds intrude into quiet scenes. This effect is similar to the gate, which is explained in another chapter, in that it blocks quiet sounds. However, while a gate completely cuts sound, an expander gradually reduces sound, resulting in a more natural and smooth decay characteristic. Its main uses are listed below: Reduce the prominence of quiet environmental noises (air conditioning, PC fans, clicks, etc.) during periods of silence Suppress noise in quiet sections while maintaining the clarity of narration and dialogue Emphasize the contours (punch) of sounds to create a more dynamic impression Expander Options The following is an explanation of each parameter when the mode is set to \" Downward .\" Attack Time : This determines the time it takes for the expander to begin suppressing the sound after the sound volume drops below the threshold. Shorter values will reduce the volume immediately, quickly suppressing noise and other imperfections. Longer values will cause the processing to begin later, preserving the natural reverberation and nuances of soft sounds. Release Time : This determines the time it takes for the expander to stop suppressing the volume and return to its original volume after the sound exceeds the threshold again and is determined to no longer require processing. Longer values will cause the sound to return more slowly, making it sound more natural. Shorter values will return the sound to its original volume quickly, making it sound clearer and tighter, but may sound unnatural in some cases. Attack Threshold : The effect is only applied to sounds quieter than this value. Release Threshold : This can be the same as the Attack Threshold, but setting it about -5dB lower than the Attack Threshold will enable the Hysteresis function, suppressing fluttering around the threshold and achieving more stable processing. Ratio : This is an indicator of how much quieter (= how much) sounds below the threshold will be reduced.

Please refer to the Compressor documentation to comprehend the basic functionality of the dynamic range compression. Global Options Band Management This Compressor allows to split the input signal up to 8 bands. Each band is not attached to its strict frequency and can be controlled by completely different frequency range that can be obtained by applying Low-Cut and Hi-Cut filters to the Sidechain signal. The first band is always enabled while the others can be activated if needed. When only the first band is enabled, the functionality is similar to the Singleband Sidechain Compressor. Otherwise the signal is split in more bands and each band is compressed individually. After the compression stage, the bands are mixed together to form the output result. Operating Mode Determines how the input signal is split to obtain the different bands. Classic - The original signal is split using crossover filters. After the compression stage, all bands become phase-compensated using All-Pass filters. Modern - Each band is processed by a pair of dynamic shelving filters. This mode allows a better control over the gain of each band. Sidechain Boost If enabled, it introduces a special mode for assigning the same weight for higher frequencies opposite to lower frequencies. When disabled, the frequency band is processed 'as is', but the usual audio signal has 3 dB/octave falloff in the frequency domain and could be compared with the pink noise. So lower frequencies take more effect on the Compressor rather than higher frequencies. On the other hand the Sidechain Boost mode allows to compensate the -3 dB/octave falloff of the signal spectrum and, even more, makes the signal spectrum growing +3 dB/octave in the almost fully audible frequency range. Pink applies +3 dB/octave while Brown applies +6 dB/octave Sidechain Boost. Each of them can use bilinear-transformed (BT) or matched-transformed (MT) shelving filter. Sidechain Source If the External Sidechain is enabled inside at least one band, this combobox allows to select the input device as source. Dry Level Amount of unprocessed signal mixed in the output. Wet Level Amount of processed signal mixed in the output. Band Options Band Start Allows to change the lower end split frequency of the selected band. This value is assigned to the Band End of the previous enabled band. It can be modified for all bands except the first one, which is always enabled and its value is 0 Hz. Band End Specify the upper end split frequency of the selected band. It cannot be directly modified and assumes the same value of the Band Start of the next enabled band. For the last enabled band it is always 24.000 Hz. Compression Mode - Downward - It's aimed to decrease the gain of the signal above the Threshold. - Upward - It's aimed to increase the gain of the signal below the Threshold. - Boosting - It's aimed to increase the gain of the signal below the Threshold by a specific amount. External Sidechain The Sidechain is an external source took by a specific input device (typically a microphone). Band Bypass If enabled, the selected band is not affected by the compression stage. Solo Turns on the Solo mode to the selected band by applying -36 dB gain to the other non-soloing bands. Mute Turns on the Mute mode applying -36 dB gain to to the selected band. Attack Time The length of time it takes to apply roughly two-thirds of the targeted amount of compression ratio to the uncompressed band signal. Release Time The length of time it takes to restore roughly two-thirds of the reduced gain (in Downward mode) or increased gain (in Upward/Boosting mode) to the compressed band signal. Attack Threshold The target level around which the compression is applied (the range depends by the Knee). Release Threshold Sets up the Threshold of the Release Time, calculated by summing the Release Threshold to the Attack Threshold. If the Sidechain level is above that Threshold, the compressor uses the Release Time for the releasing stage. Otherwise the Attack Time is used in place of Release Time. For example, with -10 dB Attack Threshold and -60 dB Release Threshold, if the Sidechain is above -10 + (-60) = -70 dB , the Release Time is used for the gain restoration. If the Sidechain is below -70 dB, the Attack Time is used for the gain restoration. Ratio The amount of attenuation (in Downward mode) or amplification (in Upward/Boosting mode) that will be applied to the signal. For example, when the Ratio is 2 in Downward mode and the Sidechain rises above the Threshold by 10 dB, the signal would be ideally reduced by 5 dB (10/2 dB). In practice this behavior mostly depends on how the Multiband Compressor is designed and configured. Knee The range over which the Compressor switches from no compression to almost the full ratio compression (the Threshold usually sits at the center of this transition zone). Makeup The gain to apply after the compression stage. Band Sidechain Options Mode Determines how the Sidechain of the selected band is evaluated for the compression stage. Peak - The Compressor reacts according to the peaks. RMS - The Compressor reacts according to the average loudness measured by the root mean square. Low-Pass - The Compressor reacts according to the signal processed by a Low-Pass filter. Uniform - The Compressor reacts according to the loudness measured by the average of the absolute amplitude. Source Determines which part of the Sidechain is taken into account for the compression stage. Middle - The sum of left and right channels. Side - The difference between left and right channels. Left - Only left channel is used. Right - Only right channel is used. Min - The absolute minimum value is taken from stereo input. Max - The absolute maximum value is taken from stereo input. Low-Cut Filter Enables a custom Low-Cut Filter for the selected band. Low-Cut Frequency Sets the cut-off frequency of the custom Low-Cut filter. If it is disabled, the default Low-Cut filter assumes internally the Band Start frequency as the cut-off frequency. Hight-Cut Filter Enables a custom High-Cut Filter for the selected band. Hight-Cut Frequency Sets the cut-off frequency of the custom High-Cut filter. If it is disabled, the default High-Cut filter assumes internally the Band End frequency as the cut-off frequency. PreAmp Gain applied to the Sidechain signal of the selected band. Reactivity The time that defines the number of samples used to process the Sidechain in RMS, Uniform and Low-Pass modes. Higher the value, more smooth the compression. Lookahead The band signal to compress is delayed by this amount of time, so that the compression will be applied earlier than it would be otherwise. Each band can have different Lookahead values. To avoid phase distortions in the mixing stage, all the bands are automatically delayed for an individually calculated period of time. Boost Amount Maximum gain amplification to apply in Boosting Mode. Boost Threshold The Threshold below which a constant amplification will be applied to the band signal in Upward Mode (it prevents from applying infinite amplification to very quiet signals).

High Consistency - Uses the method that gives greatest consistency when used to create small variations in pitch around the 1.0-ratio level.

Formant Controls the handling of formant shape (spectral envelope) when pitch-shifting. Shifted - Applies no special formant processing. The spectral envelope will be pitch shifted as normal. Preserved - Preserves the spectral envelope of the unshifted signal. This permits shifting the note frequency without so substantially affecting the perceived pitch profile of the voice or instrument. Transients Controls the component frequency phase-reset mechanism that may be used at transient points to provide clarity and realism to percussion and other significant transient sounds. Crisp - Resets component phases at the peak of each transient (the start of a significant note or percussive event). This usually results in a clear-sounding output, but it is not always consistent, and may cause interruptions in stable sounds present at the same time as transient events. Mixed - Resets component phases at the peak of each transient, outside a frequency range typical of musical fundamental frequencies. The results may be more regular for mixed stable and percussive notes than Crisp option, but with a \"phasier\" sound. The balance may sound very good for certain types of music and fairly bad for others. Smooth - Does not reset component phases at any point. The results will be smoother and more regular but may be less clear than the other transient options. Detector Controls the type of transient detector used. Compound - Uses a general purpose transient detector which is likely to be good for most situations. Percussive - Detects percussive transients. Soft - Uses an onset detector with less of a bias toward percussive transients. This may give better results with certain material (e.g. relatively monophonic piano music). Phase Controls the adjustment of component frequency phases from one analysis window to the next during non-transient segments. Laminar - Adjusts phases when stretching in such a way as to try to retain the continuity of phase relationships between adjacent frequency bins whose phases are behaving in similar ways. This should give good results in most situations. Independent - Adjusts the phase in each frequency bin independently from its neighbours. This usually results in a slightly softer, phasier sound. Cents Number of cents the Pitch will be increased or decreased. Semitones Number of semitones the Pitch will be increased or decreased. Octaves Number of octaves the Pitch will be increased or decreased.

Easy Effects uses the pitch shifter from SoundTouch. Mode Controls the method used for pitch shifting. High Speed - Uses a method with a CPU cost that is relatively moderate and predictable. High Quality - Uses the highest quality method for pitch shifting. This CPU cost is approximately proportional to the required frequency shift. High Consistency - Uses the method that gives greatest consistency when used to create small variations in pitch around the 1.0-ratio level. Unlike the previous two options, this avoids discontinuities when moving across the 1.0 pitch scale. It also consumes more CPU than the others in the case where the pitch scale is exactly 1.0. Formant Controls the handling of formant shape (spectral envelope) when pitch-shifting. Shifted - Applies no special formant processing. The spectral envelope will be pitch shifted as normal.
