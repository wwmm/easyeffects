Among other things, the tray menu shows a list of most used input and output presets.</li> <li>Our window is now more friendly to small screens. As a result it is friendlier than before to tiling window managers too.</li> <li>Easy Effects now remembers the last used plugin or tab and restores them when the window is reopened.</li> <li>The previous global bypass button is now exposed as a traditional on/off button.</li> <li>Our presets menu became a presets window that now has a third tab dedicated for autoloading profiles.</li> <li>It is now possible to set a fallback autoloading profile. If the fallback is enabled, the selected fallback preset is applied for any soundcard or microphone that does not have an autoloading profile.</li> <li>The preset autoloading tab shows the current routing of the selected input/output device.</li> <li>Presets can be renamed in our presets window.</li> <li>Presets backup can be made in our presets window.</li> <li>Our spectrum is now drawn by Qt Graphs. For now only Qt color presets are allowed, but this may change in the future.</li> <li>We added more local shortcuts, as well as the support for XDG Global Shortcuts protocol. At the moment, if the Wayland compositor correctly implements the protocol, the global effects on/off and the microphone monitor can be toggled when the windows is hidden and Easy Effects is run as background service.</li> <li>Dry and wet controls were implemented for the Convolver and Pitch plugins.</li> <li>The Pitch plugin now has a button that allows its history to be reset.</li> <li>The Crystalizer plugin now has an adaptive intensity mode.</li> <li>Our Echo Canceller is now based on the <code>webrtc</code> library instead of <code>speexdsp</code>. This should improve echo cancellation quality for many users.</li> <li>Our manual is now displayed inside our window through WebEngineView. Yelp is not necessary anymore.</li> <li>The test signal tab now can generate pink noise.</li> <li>We added a configuration option that allows the microphone monitor output to be sent to the output effects pipeline input.</li> <li>We added a new Autogain parameter that allows the output level to be forced to zero when the input level is below the silence threshold.</li> <li>Improved compatibility with the latest Linux Studio Plugins releases.</li> <li>We are now able to show Calf Studio Plugins native window.

I suggest that package maintainers take a look at our Arch Linux PKGBUILD to see everything that is necessary https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/blob/master/PKGBUILD_AUR</li> <li>The Crystalizer effect uses the adaptive intensity mode by default. Old presets generated by previous GTK versions should be resaved with adaptive intensity disabled in order to behave the same way as the old mechanism without it.</li> <li>For a long time we have been saving presets, impulse responses, rnnoise and autoload profile files in our configuration folder. What is not what XDG standard suggests to be done. Now it's the time to change that. Our master branch now saves these files inside <code>~/.local/share/easyeffects</code> and keeps only our database files inside <code>~/.config/easyeffects</code>. Easy Effects will copy the current files to the new location and move the old directories to the users trash. This way if something horrible happens the user will be able to get the files back.</li> <li>At this moment XDG global shortcuts are working well on KDE. Not so much on GNOME and maybe other desktops too. On Gnome in particular, the shortcut itself does work, but key binding customization seems to be properly implemented only by KDE. Other Wayland implementations should be tested and we invite users to let us know how it works.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#725","title":"7.2.5","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#2025-07-18","title":"2025-07-18","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#features_10","title":"Features:","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#bug-fixes_10","title":"Bug fixes:","text":"<ul> <li>Fixed a bug in the pitch plugin that made the cents and the octaves control to not be reapplied when EasyEffects was restarted</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#other-notes_10","title":"Other notes:","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#724","title":"7.2.4","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#2025-07-07","title":"2025-07-07","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#features_11","title":"Features:","text":"<ul> <li>The Pitch plugin has new cents and octaves parameters.</li> <li>The client-rt.conf is ignored on 1.4.0 or newer PipeWire versions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#bug-fixes_11","title":"Bug fixes:","text":"<ul> <li>APO export does not crash anymore when an unsupported LSP Equalizer filter is set.</li> <li>Fixed a bug in LADSPA wrapper.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#other-notes_11","title":"Other notes:","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#723","title":"7.2.3","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#2025-01-06","title":"2025-01-06","text":""},{"location":"community/CHANGELOG.html#features_12","title":"Features:","text":"<ul> <li>Improved compatibility with future PipeWire releases.

The difference with Local Presets is that community ones are intended to be easily installed since not all users were able to find presets on the internet, which were practically reported in one of the subpage of the Github project (that linked other repositories where the user should manually download them on the local storage). Now it should be easier to discover them making a search on the repository or your favorite distribution.</p> <p>Instead the Local Presets list is intended to save self-made presets and/or a selected choice of presets imported by the community list. Importing presets locally is essential when the user wants to autoload and associate them to a specific device.

Nevertheless this would confuse users seeing multiple presets with the same package name in the menu list. For this reasons we recommend to try to use unique package names. So choose a name that you know it won't be used by other packagers, maybe including your nickname.</p> <p>In example: - <code>XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets</code> - <code>XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/Digitalone</code> - <code>XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/vchernin</code></p>"},{"location":"community/COMMUNITY_PRESETS_GUIDELINES.html#how-easy-effects-looks-for-community-presets","title":"How Easy Effects looks for Community Presets","text":"<p>Basically Easy Effects scans every directory with the package name looking for: - Files with the <code>.json</code> extension. - - The packager should take care of the integrity of those <code>.json</code> files being text files that can be correctly parsed by the application in order to be loaded without errors. - The scan takes place only in the first and the second level of the directory with the package name.

For a better understanding and because of the way we will solve our problems I'll break it down to five ranges which are:</p> <ul> <li>Sub \u2013 More or less vibrations up to something an ear can barely hear. Everything from 10 Hz to ~40 Hz.</li> <li>Low or Bass \u2013 Where the whole fundament of a signal is located. Low end of bass drums, bass synthesizers and bass guitars are found here. Movies occupy this range with explosions, rumbling waters, thunder, heavy gun fire and the like. Absolutely missing on notebooks and tablets. Technically speaking it's ~60 Hz - ~200 Hz.</li> <li>Low-Mid \u2013 Hit a 0.5 m\u00b3 cardboard box and you know what low-mids are. The \"punch\" of a sound is often located here, also the juice of snare drums and electric guitars. In Movies, roaring engines and shotguns are found in this range. We're talking about ~250 Hz - ~750 Hz.</li> <li>High-Mid \u2013 This is the ears most important and sensitive range. The main information of any kind of signal is located here. Human voice, picking of guitars, attack of drums, the colour of a synthesizer - everything carrying the main information of sound. Something around ~1 kHz - ~4 kHz.</li> <li>Highs \u2013 The air, the breathe, the sizzling, the splashing - this is the range of brightness. Everything around and above ~5 kHz.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#test-signal","title":"Test Signal","text":"<p>You definitely need a good signal for this job. I decided to use the song G\u20acLD by Seeed.</p> <p>It is quite snappy, has lots of well defined substance, clear and bright highs, present vocals, comes with a very balanced frequency response and is a great mix in combination with great mastering. Afterwards I tested against various movies and other stuff like talks, classical music and the like and was convinced of the result. Well produced, modern pop music (avoid the 80's and 90's stuff) is always a good test signal for this kind of job. Movies are way too dynamic, so is classical music, and they normally don't cover a steady, broad frequency range like this kind of signal.</p> <p>We will not be able to make the notebook bounce. What is the goal here is that everything contained in the mix gets audible in a well balanced manner and to gain a present, upfront, broad and hopefully rich sound.</p> <p>I assume you don't utilize a player or source which is able to produce levels above 0 dB. I also assume you don't use e.g. video players volume bar to lower the volume of your source. This approach works well for defined, mixed and mastered sound sources like music, movies, tv and the like, played back at 100% volume in the player. Set the desired volume directly on your hardware after the processing happened.</p>"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#problems","title":"Problems","text":"<p>Let's investigate the biggest problems first:</p> <p>Bass The most obvious problem of notebook speakers is the tinny, pressure-free sound not reproducing any kind of low-end. This is because of the size of the membranes and the inadequate housing. Fortunately software can work around this issue at least a bit.</p> <p>Highs Often the highs are quite bitchy, not representing the \"air\" but torturing the listener with searing sibilants. In order to fix that we need to equal this frequency range out.</p> <p>Overall Frequency Response Normally the relation between the different frequency ranges low, low-mid, high-mid and height is quite out-of-bounds. This needs correction, although I promised a tutorial without EQ.</p> <p>Distortion Because of the thin and neutered sound users tend to raise the volume or even add an Equalizer to raise missing frequency ranges. This normally leads to digital distortions because every signal above 0 dB at the sound card DAC will go from occasional crackling up to a totally distorted sound.</p> <p>Dynamic range With movies, but music as well, those tiny transducers tend to wiping away low-level sounds but going ballistic on loud and bassy sounds. For this reason it's recommended to reduce the overall dynamic range so you don't need to press your ear onto the palm rest when the lady in the movie starts whispering.</p> <p>Stereo Image The stereo base is quite narrow because of the positioning of the speakers inside the laptop which gives an impression of almost mono signals.</p>"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#solutions","title":"Solutions","text":"<p>Let's start fixing the sound. The result will not come even close to something more substantial but at least we'll be able to get the best out of the physical boundaries of these transducers.</p> <p>Every parameter we are gonna set absolutely depends on your situation and the hardware you've got. Every notebook has its own frequency response and dynamic range so there's no panacea. But the audio signal processors, their order and their missions are well defined and reproducible.</p> <p>Don't care about clipping in the plugins level meters. The signal will be processed as 32 bit numbers internally (check title bar) which gives a non-clipping overhead of hundreds of decibels. The only thing that shouldn't happen is that there's clipping when the signal hits the sound card DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter), which would result in digital distortion.</p> <p>Let's head over to the signal chain:</p> <p>Limiter We will start with the last signal processor being used. As I explained earlier, as soon as the signal hits the sound card DAC it has to be below 0 dB, otherwise it will result in a distorted, messy sound.</p> <p>Delete already present processors in the list, then add the Limiter. You will not hear any difference, which is what we expect. It will hit in as soon as we start messing up the signal with all the other processors. Set PreAmp to 0 dB, Lookahead to 4 ms, Attack to 2 ms and Release to 8 ms.</p> <p>A Limiter monitors the signal in (nearly) realtime and detects peaks over a certain Threshold, in our case 0 dB. Set also Stereo Link to 100%, Oversampling to Half x4, disable External Sidechain and Auto Leveling and leave remaining options to their defaults.</p> <p>As soon as a peak is detected, it starts lowering the volume constantly (within the Lookahead) until the peak will be below Threshold. Afterwards it raises the volume again (within release time frame) until it is back to normal. This way we avoid signals above Threshold hitting the DAC without being noticed too much. If one tries to overdo limiting, it will definitely result in distortion and other side effects, but in our case it's just a fire-and-forget troubleshooter so we can concentrate on the results without trying to mess with levelling over and over again.</p> <p>Don't overdo things! This might render your overall sound experience worse than before.</p> <p>Let's look at the real processing now.</p> <p>Filter First of all we should remove frequencies that cannot be heard because even if the speakers are unable to reproduce them a lot of energy will be wasted in the process. This will lead to problems like not being able to use the full dynamic range and the introduction of digital and physical distortions.</p> <p>Add the Filter to the list and place it on top, above the Limiter. Set the type to 36 dB High Pass (this will cut off everything below a frequency and will let everything above it pass) and the frequency to 50 Hz (which is definitely below your laptop's speakers abilities). Continuously raise the frequency by 10 Hz until you start hearing a change in the lower end of the audible signal, which should be around 130-160 Hz. Subtract 10% (or 15 Hz) and set it as the Filters frequency. On my machine it is 145 Hz, since the signal started being affected at 160 Hz.</p> <p>What happened is that we removed everything the speakers can't reproduce at all, leaving a little bit of signal just below this frequency, which is quite important for the next step.</p> <p>Bass Enhancer Let's grow some testicles to the signal.</p> <p>Add the Bass Enhancer and place it at the second position, between the Filter and the Limiter. Set the Floor to 10 Hz and forget about it (we already removed everything below the Filter plugin cutoff frequency). Raise Harmonics to 10 and start with a Scope of 200 Hz. Now start raising the Amount continuously until the bass takes over the whole energy, which is definitely too much. For me it works best at +24 dB. Which is huge but my ThinkPad P1 has the worst speakers I've ever heard in a 2.8k \u20ac notebook.</p> <p>What happens is that the Bass Enhancer adds frequencies to the signal which weren't there before. While an Equalizer only raises stuff which is already in the signal, a Bass Enhancer improves the lower end by adding distortion to a specific frequency range. This kind of distortion adds so called Harmonics to the signal which is a multiple of existing frequencies. On the Blend slider you can choose seamlessly between 2nd and 3rd Harmonics, which means that a frequency of 100 Hz produces a new signal of 200/300/400/600/800/900 Hz... at varying (due to the Harmonics setting) and constantly decreasing levels. This means we're effectively raising the lower range into something better reproducible. It doesn't add or raise the real fundament (so your trousers won't start to flutter), but makes more audible signals that have been swallowed by the hardware before.</p> <p>Later on, in order to refine the result, you should play with the Amount parameter to define the level of bass and maybe with the Scope to define the upper end of our additional Harmonics.</p> <p>Multiband Compressor This is the most demanding step in the chain. Even professionals have great respect for this signal processor since it's absolutely able to destroy your signals big time. But let's be honest, we're consumers and no one will hear the difference between 100 ms and 200 ms Attack time - even on notebook and tablet speakers. This means we can work with some reliable, well established defaults for the timing and frequency splits.</p> <p>The Multiband Compressor will solve several things for us. It will cut outstanding and annoying frequencies, lower the overall dynamic range and figure our overall frequency response. The latter is what most people try to achieve with an Equalizer. Thing is Equalizers aren't dynamic which will add to the problems instead of solving anything.</p> <p>Add the Multiband Compressor and place it at the third position, after the Bass Enhancer and before the Limiter.</p> <p>Since the Bass Enhancer really raised the energy and level of the signal, lower the Multiband Compressor input gain to -6 dB as a starting point. Enable bands 2, 3 and 4. Set Modern Operating Mode and disable the Sidechain Boost. Then let's set the split frequencies for the different bands:</p> <ul> <li>Band 2 Start: 250 Hz </li> <li>Band 3 Start: 1250 Hz</li> <li>Band 4 Start: 5000 Hz</li> </ul> <p>Afterwards let's set some defaults:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Band 1</p> <ul> <li>Attack Time: 150 ms</li> <li>Release Time: 300 ms</li> <li>Attack Threshold: -16 dB</li> <li>Ratio: 5</li> <li>Knee: -12 dB</li> <li>Makeup: 4 dB</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Band 2</p> <ul> <li>Attack Time: 150 ms</li> <li>Release Time: 200 ms</li> <li>Attack Threshold: -24 dB</li> <li>Ratio: 3</li> <li>Knee: -9 dB</li> <li>Makeup: 4 dB</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Band 3</p> <ul> <li>Attack Time: 100 ms</li> <li>Release Time: 150 ms</li> <li>Attack Threshold: -24 dB</li> <li>Ratio: 3</li> <li>Knee: -9 dB</li> <li>Makeup: 4 dB</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Band 4</p> <ul> <li>Attack Time: 80 ms</li> <li>Release Time: 120 ms</li> <li>Attack Threshold: -24 dB</li> <li>Ratio: 4</li> <li>Knee: -9 dB</li> <li>Makeup: 4 dB</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Compression Mode for all enabled bands should be Downward. The remaining parameters can be left to their defaults. These values should be a good starting point.</p> <p>A Compressor lowers signal levels which appear above a certain Threshold. It adds a simple multiplication to the signal defined by the Ratio. If the Threshold is set to -24 dB and Ratio to 2, a signal of -12 dB would in fact become -18 dB. In this example one can then raise the Makeup parameter to 6 dB, since this is what went \"lost\". So first of all we're rendering loud signals quieter to then raise the overall volume, which leads to less dynamic range with quiet parts becoming more audible.</p> <p>The timing settings affect the \"speed\" of the compression. Attack means that a signal needs to go over Threshold for this amount of time until the Compressor reaches the full (negative) amplification. Release defines the amount of time the signal has to stay below Threshold until the amplification is back to 1 again.</p> <p>A Multiband Compressor splits the signal in various frequency ranges to work on them exclusively with dedicated compression stages. This means that a very loud bass drum would not affect a crash cymbal, since they are clearly located in different bands.</p> <p>Start playing around with these parameters:</p> <p>Makeup \u2013 This is probably most important setting in this concept. Makeup raises the signal after compression stage which means that it directly influences the perceived volume of every single band. Or in other words: this is your Equalizer :). Raise Makeup of single bands to make them louder or quieter. On my ThinkPad P1 I ended up with 4 dB, 3 dB, 6 dB and 6 dB respectively in band 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p> <p>Input Level \u2013 Set it to -6 dB by default, I ended up at -3 dB. What happens is that a higher input level pushes all bands of the Compressor equally, leading to a allegedly louder sound (well, the loudness was raised in fact) without tweaking every single band manually. This reduces the overall dynamic range, raising quiet parts and squeezing loud parts even more.</p> <p>Stereo Tools After figuring our overall sound let's look for some icing on the cake.</p> <p>Add the Stereo Tools and place it at the fourth position, after Multiband Compressor and before Limiter. This tool has a lot of functionality but we only need just a single parameter. Switch to the \"Output\" tab and set the parameter Stereo Base to 0.25. That's it.</p> <p>Stereo Base acts on the two channels. It adds inverted signals crossover-wise. This way one can bring a full stereo signal down to mono seamlessly (by going negative values, -1 is fully mono) but also raise the stereo base by choosing positive numbers. This setting has lots of side effects, so avoid overdoing it! One of the bigger problems is that it reduces the bass range due to different effects, which is something we definitely don't want here.</p> <p>Play with Stereo Base to spread the appearance of your sound to a nice, broad stage without losing the center (vocals, snare drums, conversations in movies) or substance in the lower end. Most likely values between 0 and 0.5 will give some good results.</p>"},{"location":"guides/guide_1.html#aftermath","title":"Aftermath","text":"<p>Hopefully you ended up with a better sound than before.

This technology uses AI technology called deep learning to efficiently remove noise from audio signals, enabling higher quality noise suppression than conventional methods. This technology has several control parameters, which are explained below and how to set them.</p> <p>Attenuation Limit This parameter determines how much noise is attenuated. Higher values result in stronger noise reduction, but too high a value may also remove parts of the audio.</p> <ul> <li>Recommended setting: 70dB to 80dB is a typical balanced value. This minimizes background noise while preserving speech intelligibility.</li> </ul> <p>Minimum Processing Threshold Signals below the Minimum Processing Threshold are targeted for denoising. Signals louder than this threshold are not subject to noise reduction and are passed through unchanged. This setting is intended to effectively remove small background noise.</p> <ul> <li>Recommended setting: -15dB to -30dB is good. This should be fine-tuned according to the ambient noise. Currently, Easy Effects does not allow a value smaller than -15dB.</li> </ul> <p>Maximum ERB Processing Threshold The human auditory system has the ability to separate and recognize different frequency components. Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) is a numerical expression and model of this filtering capability. ERB-based processing emphasizes the perceptual importance of speech by focusing on specific frequency bands. This improves the effectiveness of noise reduction and speech enhancement. This threshold sets the maximum level at which perceptually equivalent bandwidth (ERB)-based processing is applied. Signals above this threshold are not subject to noise reduction or speech enhancement processing. This prevents important speech components or loud portions of speech from being unnecessarily processed.</p> <ul> <li>Recommended setting: Start in the range of 20dB to 30dB and adjust as needed.</li> </ul> <p>Maximum DF Processing Threshold The Maximum DF Processing Threshold sets the maximum level of signal that DeepFilterNet will process. Signals exceeding this threshold are excluded from noise reduction processing. This prevents important or loud portions of speech from being unnecessarily processed.</p> <ul> <li>Recommended setting: 20 dB as the default value. This effectively suppresses noise while maintaining voice quality.</li> </ul> <p>Minimum Processing Buffer Defines the size of the buffer used to process frames of audio data.
