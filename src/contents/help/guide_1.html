                                        like me - own a model suffering from a tinny, clanging sound, Easy Effects is
                                        your salvation!</p>
                                    <p class="p">Commercial operating systems on laptops these days often come with
                                        software like Dolby Theatre and the like to enhance the sound of lousy notebook
                                        speakers to something more substantial and acoustically rich. Under Linux, Easy
                                        Effects will do the job for you, although, compared to the commercial pendants,
                                        there's some manual tweaking required until the community sets up a database
                                        with presets for common machines.</p>
                                    <p class="p">This DSP software comes with everything needed to fatten the sound of
                                        your laptop speakers with a flexibility never found in other operating systems.
                                        Unfortunately the drawback of this flexibility is that average users will get
                                        lost in the sheer amount of possibilities. That's why this tutorial was created.

                                    <p class="p">We will attack the problems one by one utilizing specific signal
                                        processors, deliberately renouncing Equalizers. Equalizers are not of any help
                                        here but tend to make these kinds of problems even worse. This is because of the
                                        nature of this processor, but also because users tend to add to the signal
                                        (additive equalization) instead of trying to eliminate problems by removing from
                                        the signal (subtractive equalization) like it is usually done in the
                                        professional world.</p>
                                    <p class="p">But even subtractive equalization wouldn't be of any help since the
                                        amplifiers and speakers in a notebook are not loud enough by default, so trying
                                        to eliminate problems this way leads to a quiet and still castrated sound. And
                                        raising the volume afterwards generally leads to distorted sounds and other
                                        problems because the system was at its limits beforehand and just fiddling with
                                        the frequency response doesn't help at all.</p>

                                        is a great mix in combination with great mastering. Afterwards I tested against
                                        various movies and other stuff like talks, classical music and the like and was
                                        convinced of the result. Well produced, modern pop music (avoid the 80's and
                                        90's stuff) is always a good test signal for this kind of job. Movies are way
                                        too dynamic, so is classical music, and they normally don't cover a steady,
                                        broad frequency range like this kind of signal.</p>

                                        is that everything contained in the mix gets audible in a well balanced manner
                                        and to gain a present, upfront, broad and hopefully rich sound.</p>

                                        levels above 0 dB. I also assume you don't use e.g. video players volume bar to
                                        lower the volume of your source. This approach works well for defined, mixed and

                                        and the hardware you've got. Every notebook has its own frequency response and
                                        dynamic range so there's no panacea. But the audio signal processors, their
                                        order and their missions are well defined and reproducible.</p>
                                    <p class="p">Don't care about clipping in the plugins level meters. The signal will
                                        be processed as 32 bit numbers internally (check title bar) which gives a
                                        non-clipping overhead of hundreds of decibels. The only thing that shouldn't
                                        happen is that there's clipping when the signal hits the sound card DAC
                                        (Digital-to-Analog Converter), which would result in digital distortion.</p>

                                                            will be below Threshold. Afterwards it raises the volume
                                                            again (within release time frame) until it is back to
                                                            normal. This way we avoid signals above Threshold hitting

                                                            multiple of existing frequencies. On the Blend slider you
                                                            can choose seamlessly between 2nd and 3rd Harmonics, which
                                                            means that a frequency of 100 Hz produces a new signal of
